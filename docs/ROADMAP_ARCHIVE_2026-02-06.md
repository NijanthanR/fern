# Legacy Roadmap Archive Pointer

The previous long-form roadmap archive was retired during the repository cleanup pass to avoid stale, non-actionable checklists.

Use these sources instead:

- Active plan: [`../ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md)
- Curated history: [`HISTORY.md`](HISTORY.md)
- Architecture decisions: [`../DECISIONS.md`](../DECISIONS.md)

If detailed historical diffs are needed, use git history:

```bash
git log -- ROADMAP.md
git log -- docs/ROADMAP_ARCHIVE_2026-02-06.md
```
